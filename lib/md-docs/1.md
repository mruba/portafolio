# Factory Pattern

> Creation of objects and particularly with delegating the creation of objects using sub-classes

The objects you want to create usually share a common characteristic; they are similar in nature or in type, or they are part of a hierarchy.

Using the Factory method assumes you want to avoid the traditional way of creating objects and instead you describe what you want to create. At runtime, when you pass the parameters to the create method, it will call the right constructor objects for you. Next, you learn when this is necessary for certain situations.

```js
interface Weapon {
    getName(): string;
    getDamage(): number;
    getRange(): number;
}

class LongSword implements Weapon {

    getName(): string {
        return "LongSword";
    }

    getDamage(): number {
        return 10;
    }

    getRange(): number {
        return 2;
    }

}

class LongBow implements Weapon {

    getName(): string {
        return "LongBow";
    }

    getDamage(): number {
        return 8;
    }

    getRange(): number {
        return 16;
    }
}

const enum WeaponType {
    LONGBOW,
    LONGSWORD,
  }

  class WeaponCreator {
    create(weaponType: WeaponType): Weapon {
       switch (weaponType) {
          case WeaponType.LONGBOW: {
             return new LongBow();
             break;
          }

          case WeaponType.LONGSWORD: {
             return new LongSword();
             break;
          }
       }
    }
  }


  const wp = new WeaponCreator()
  console.debug(wp.create(WeaponType.LONGBOW))
  console.debug(wp)
```
